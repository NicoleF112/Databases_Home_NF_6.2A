Steps done for set up:

Firstly I checked if I had the right python version installed and checked vs Code if I had the python installations.

Then I added some code to the terminal to create a virtual environment setup:
    python -m venv env
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    env\Scripts\activate (since its for windows)

After I installed the dependencies and used pip freeze > requirements.txt to get a text file of all the dependencies installed. 

which you can get by using: pip -r requirements.txt
